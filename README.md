# Horiseon: New and Improved Code

## Horiseon: New and Improved Code is the title of the project that I embarked on these past two weeks. This project was devoted to taking the code of a webpage that was fully functional, but lacked accessibility for individuals who use search engines. When I received this code, I was motivated to make it easier to read for individuals, but also make the webpage easier for individuals to access. I believe that after working on this project for the last two weeks, I have been successful at organizing the code better and making the webpage more easy to read. 

## I took several steps when beginning this project. As I took a first look at the code in the file "index.html, I was very confused as it did not necessarily follow the order of the webpage and was divided into "divs", which did not necesarily indicate what the div contained. There was also a lack of comments. I decided that my first step would be to make the divs into a header, a main section, a benefits section with articles inside it, and a footer. I added comments before these different components and spaced it out a little more to clearly divide each component from the one it followed and the one it preceded.

## The second step I took was regarding the css file "style.css". I realized that the css file had several of the same faults. The order of the style attributes did not align with the order of the components in the "index.html" file, so I dedcided to order them in the sequence that they were going appear in the web page as well. While looking at both the index.html and style.css files, I realized that there were numerous classes that were titled different, yet contributed the same style modifications. I decided to consolidate these classes into one to make the style.css code a little neater. After these modifications, I met the requirements that the marketing agency put out of being able to find semantic HMTL elements, observe a logic structure, view accessible alt attributes for th eiamge elements, find the heading attributes in a sequential order, and discern a concise, descriptive title for the code. 

## The following screenshots depict the webpage how it looks on my desktop as it deploys from my console.
